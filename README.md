# Mini-project-D7041E
This project aims to classify bird sounds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The dataset is sourced from xeno-canto, a platform for sharing bird sound recordings worldwide. The sounds are preprocessed into spectrograms, and a CNN model is trained for accurate classification.
